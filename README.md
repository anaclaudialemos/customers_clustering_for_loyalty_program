## Business Problem
The AllOne company is a multi-brand company, i.e., it sells products from various brands through an e-commerce site.

In just over a year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers in its base, buy more expensive products, with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue.Based on this perception, the marketing team will launch a loyalty program for the best customers in the base, called Insiders. 

As the team does not have an advanced knowledge in data analysis to elect the program participants, the marketing team asked the data team to select eligible customers for the Insiders program. With this list, the Marketing team will tailor a sequence of unique and personalized actions to the group in order to increase revenue and purchase frequency.

As an output for this project, the data team is expected to deliver a list of people eligible to join the Insiders program, along with a report answering the following questions:

1. Who are the people eligible to participate in the Insiders program ?
2. How many customers will be part of the group?
3. What are the main characteristics of these customers?
4. What is the percentage of revenue contribution coming from the Insiders?
5. What is the expected revenue of this group for the next months?
6. What are the conditions for a person to be eligible to join Insiders?
7. How can a person be removed from the Insiders program?
8. How is it guaranteed that the Insiders is better than the rest of the base ?
9. What actions can the marketing team take to increase revenue?
